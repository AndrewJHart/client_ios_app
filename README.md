Backbone client using coenraets iphone native CSS. Offers real time notifications using Pusher and implements a modified version of the backbone-live library which allows for pusher or falls back to polling. No localstorage yet. Works on same API (Django + Tastypie using signals to notify pusher on create, update, delete). Completely RESTful based implementation.
